<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> little Arabian cousins live in a far-away
land, where all the manners and customs of life
are very different from our own.</p>

<p>The little Arab children of the desert are
quite different from those who live in the towns,
as, indeed, are their elders. The Bedouins of
the desert are by no means an uncivilized race,
and their kind-heartedness and strict regard for
doing by others as they would be done by is a
marked feature of their daily life.</p>

<p>This little book tells of the comings and goings
of two little children of the desert; how
they lived their lives; their plays and games;
and many of the curious sights they saw as they
travelled about with their parents, on one occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
visiting the great city of Medina, where
they were as much strangers as if they were
little American cousins who had come there on
a journey.</p>

<p>Arabia itself is a wild, sad country, but with
here and there great patches of verdure, date-palms,
cocoanuts, and coffee plants which give
prosperity to the inhabitants. Some of the
tribes are warlike and less peaceful than others,
but they are the outcasts of the country, the
same as are found elsewhere than in Arabia.</p>

<p>Our little Arabian cousins have much in common
with other little cousins, in that they are
very strictly brought up, and are taught to have
a great respect for their elders, and particularly
to be polite and thoughtful to strangers. Their
games and many of the acts of their daily lives
are what we ourselves would consider violent
and rough, but that only shapes them in their
future careers to live up to their ancestral traditions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>RASHID COMES TO THE BLACK TENTS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">They</span> come, father, they come; I see a
cloud of dust just over the hills," cried young
Hamid, galloping up on his fiery little pony to
where his father sat proudly on his horse, with
a number of the men of his tribe around him.
Al-Abukar, Hamid's father, was a grave, dignified
Bedouin Arab, with a flowing beard and
a long white cloak completely covering him.
In his right hand he held a long lance or spear.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," said Al-Abukar, shading his
eyes with his hand, as he looked out across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
desert, "'tis only the sand caught up in a swirl
of the wind. Be not impatient, my son," he
continued, "thou wilt tire both thyself and the
little mare if thou dashest needlessly about, and
neither of you will be able to greet thy little
friend with the proper spirit."</p>

<p>Hamid and Zuleika, the little pony, both
tossed their heads at the idea of such a thing;
and no wonder! for Hamid belonged to the
Beni-Harb, one of the best and bravest of the
Bedouin tribes. As for Zuleika, she had come
from the Nijd Desert, where the finest Arabian
horses are bred, and it was said she was a descendant
of the famous horse of Saladin, the
great Arab ruler of olden times.</p>

<p>The pony's coat was rough and shaggy, and
not smooth and glossy as we like to see; but
Hamid could soon show you all her good points.
The small head, with its thin pointed ears, wide
nostrils, and large eyes, and the proud arch of
her neck and the network of muscles on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
wiry legs all showed that she was an Arabian
horse of the bluest blood.</p>

<p>Hamid and his father had ridden out into
the desert to meet little Rashid, a young friend
of theirs who lived in the city of Medina.
Rashid had been ill, and it was not easy to get
well in the hot, narrow, ill-smelling streets of
an Arabian city; so his father was bringing
him to stay some months with Hamid, that he
might live in a tent and breathe the dry, pure
air of the desert, drink plenty of camel's milk,
and thus become well and strong.</p>

<p>"The People of the Walls," as the Arabs
of the desert call the folk who live in the towns,
often send their children to live for awhile in
the "Black Tents" in the desert, that they may
grow up strong and healthy and become hardy
and brave like the Bedouins themselves. The
Bedouins, the real desert Arabs, are among the
bravest and most courageous people in all the
world. The "Black Tents," the habitations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the Bedouins, are so called because they are
made of a material very sombre and dark in
colour.</p>

<p>"Could we not ride farther out to meet our
friends?" asked Hamid, for both he and Zuleika
were becoming more and more restless.</p>

<p>"I fear we should miss them, for I know
not whether they will come over the ridge or
by the road up the valley," said his father.</p>

<p>Just at this moment one of the Bedouins
called out: "Do I not see the dust from the
camels' feet over yonder?"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is truly they; haste and we will give
them welcome." So saying, Al-Abukar spurred
his horse forward, and Hamid and his pony
were not far behind. Together they flew like
the wind over the sand and rocks.</p>

<p>As they came in sight of their friends, they
shouted out their names, at the same time
throwing their lances into the air and catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them again, and firing off their guns in real
circus fashion.</p>

<p>You would think that all this would frighten
one's friends to death, but this is only the polite
Bedouin way of welcoming any one.</p>

<p>The camels of the caravan which was bringing
the people from Medina came to a halt and
everybody dismounted, and loud and warm
were the greetings between friends.</p>

<p>Hamid and Rashid clapped the palms of their
right hands together, and then touched foreheads
and put their arms around each other's
necks. This is the real Arab form of greeting
a friend. They are more affectionate than any
of the other Eastern nations, and show their joy
and happiness with much emotion when meeting
friends or relatives.</p>

<p>All now formed one group and rode along
together until they came in sight of a grove of
palm-trees in the midst of which was Hamid's
home, a great brown tent made of cloth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
camel's hair, and held to the ground by ropes
tightly pegged down so that the strong winds
of the desert might not overturn it. All around
were the tents of other Bedouins, relatives and
friends of Al-Abukar, belonging to the same
tribe.</p>

<p>As our party reached the tents, the men and
children left behind came forward to welcome
them with shouts and more gun-firing.</p>

<p>"Prepare the guest-rice at once," called out
Al-Abukar, as he pulled aside the curtains of
the tent for his friends to enter. Here was
Zubaydah, Hamid's mother, ready to welcome
them, and she had the black servant bring a
large bowl of water so that they could wash
off the dust of travel.</p>

<p>After this all sat around on rugs, and Rashid
was made to lie down on a pile of cushions,
for he was very tired after his long journey.
Fatimah, Hamid's little sister, now brought the
guests rose-water with which to bathe their fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and faces once more, and bowls of water,
sweetened with the juice of pomegranates, to
drink.</p>

<p>"In the name of Allah, the Merciful!" exclaimed
every one, as each took a drink from
the bowl; and, after they had finished, "Praise
be to Allah!"</p>

<p>"Pleasure and health to thee," said Al-Abukar,
politely, as he put his great hubble-bubble
pipe before his friend, first taking a puff
at it himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hamid was busy pounding coffee,
which had been freshly roasted, into a powder,
with a mortar and pestle. This is always the
occupation of the oldest son when guests are
about, the father taking it upon himself to make
the coffee afterwards. The Arabs are great
coffee-drinkers, and it is from Arabia that the
finest <i>mocha</i> comes. It gets its name from a
town in the southern part of Arabia.</p>

<p>Al-Abukar made the coffee in a great brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
urn, mixing the ground coffee with sweet-smelling
herbs. As soon as it was ready for drinking,
he himself took the first cup, after which
tiny brass cups were filled and passed around to
the guests. He did not fill the cups quite full;
for that, for some reason, would be a great
insult to his guests. Moreover, the cups were
so tiny that they held hardly more than the cups
of a doll's tea-service would hold. Each emptied
his cup twice of the delicious coffee without
milk or sugar; but not for anything would
Al-Abukar have offered them a third, for that
would be deemed a hint that he wished his
guests to leave.</p>

<p>Now all the relatives and friends from the
other tents came in to call, and sat around smoking
and drinking still more coffee, and listening
to the gossip of the city and country.</p>

<p>The Bedouins are very hospitable, look upon
a guest and his rights as sacred, and are ever
ready to avenge a wrong against him. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Bedouin will entertain any one who calls at his
tent; and, while you are his guest, you will be
protected to the utmost power of your host, and
treated quite as one of the family. At the
same time a stranger is only expected to stay
three days; but, when he leaves, his host simply
passes him on to another friend or relative,
where he may stay another three days. He is
welcomed thus by as many of the tribe as he
wishes to visit. All very delightful this, you
will think; and, if you ever wish to visit your
little Arabian cousins, you will always be sure
of a warm welcome.</p>

<p>A Bedouin will never harm any one after he
has once eaten with him. They call this "eating
salt" together; and there are some tribes
that expect every stranger they come across to
eat with them in order that eternal peace may
be assured.</p>

<p>Just now there was a smell of good cooking
coming from that part of the tent which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
curtained off for the women, and where Zubaydah
and the black servants were making all
sorts of dishes for the visitors. One of the
servants having ground the wheat for the bread
between two great stones, it was mixed with
milk and bean flour and made into round, flat,
thin cakes. Then it was baked in a queer kind
of an oven shaped like a big jar with a wide
mouth.</p>

<p>Besides these hot cakes, there was to be the
"guest-rice," all swimming in melted butter.
There was goat's meat, too, of which the Arabs
are very fond; but which we would think a
little strong to eat often. Curds made of camel's
milk were a special feature, and many kinds
of soft white cheeses, as well as dates, grapes,
and pomegranates.</p>

<p>All these things were put on a great brass
tray, which was placed on a low table in the
centre of the tent. Every one sat closely around
the table, and all said "<i>Bismillah</i>" before eating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which is the Mohammedan way of saying
grace.</p>

<p>Al-Abukar helped himself first; and then put
a choice bit into his friend's mouth. Then
every one began to dip into the dishes with their
fingers, because there were no knives or forks
or separate plates. They all ate with a good
appetite, for there is nothing like the desert air
to give one a good appetite.</p>

<p>Zubaydah waited on the guests herself, and
afterwards ate with the children, who meantime
had been simply looking on.</p>

<p>After the meal was over, they all sat around
in a cool corner of the tent, the men smoking
their great pipes again. Hamid could not keep
his eyes off the beautiful sword and the brace
of fine pistols with their red cords, which belonged
to his father's friend. They were the
most beautiful things he had ever seen, he
thought.</p>

<p>Hamid had not a bit of the shyness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Eastern children usually have, for the Arab
children are taught from their earliest days always
to be independent; and their elders talk
with them and encourage them to ask questions.
This is a part of their education.</p>

</div>

<p>So Hamid was told all about Medina and
the doings of the great city; and his father's
friend took off his great sword that Hamid
might fasten it at his own waist.</p>

<p>"Some day I shall have a sword just like
that," said Hamid, as he handed it back, after
having marched around the tent with it dragging
on the ground behind him. Rashid lay
on the soft cushions and laughed, still too tired
to get up and rush about as Hamid was doing.</p>

<p>Rashid's father, the Sharif, had brought a
gift of a beautiful chased dagger of Damascus
steel for Al-Abukar.</p>

<p>"It is indeed a beautiful weapon," said
Hamid's father, feeling its polished blade with
careful fingers. No gift could possibly please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
an Arab more than a good weapon, and he
thanked his friend from the city again and
again.</p>

<p>"Here is also a toy from the bazaar that
I have brought thy son," said the Sharif.
"See," he continued, "it is a toy camel with
a strange device inside its body by which it
moves its head and legs. 'Tis one of those
strange mechanical toys that are the work of
infidels in a foreign land, but all the same none
the less wonderful for that." (The Mohammedans
call all the people of other faiths infidels.)</p>

<p>"Nay, one needs no toys from the town,"
said Hamid, proudly. "We play with live
camels and horses and chase the wild beasts
across the desert."</p>

<p>We would think it very rude indeed of a
little boy to speak thus; but instead of scolding
Hamid, they praised him; and the Sharif said,
smilingly, "Truly thou art one of the 'sons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fight.'" That is what the word Beni-Harb, the
name of their tribe, means in the Arabic language.</p>

<p>This is the true Arab spirit; and children are
taught to scorn childish things so that they may
the sooner become hardy and brave in any kind
of danger. It is really very funny to see the
little boys act and talk as if they were already
grown men like their fathers; and they would
much rather play with swords and pistols any
day than with toys.</p>

<p>"Indeed thou art a little fighting hawk.
May Allah grant that the sweet wind of the
desert put strength into the limbs of my son,"
continued Al-Abukar's guest, looking sorrowfully
at little Rashid's pale cheeks as he lay on
his cushions.</p>

<p>"He is a little better already," said Zubaydah,
kindly, as she gave little Fatimah a censer
of burning musk to swing before her guests, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they might enjoy the smell of sweet perfumes
after the meal.</p>

<p>"I will show you my falcons if you are not
too tired," said Hamid, anxious to amuse his
little friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I am not tired. Where are
they?" cried Rashid, jumping up and forgetting
all about his long ride.</p>

<p>Hamid led his little guest out among the
great palm-trees and past a great many tents
to a sort of mud hut thatched with palm
leaves.</p>

<p>"How are the birds to-day?" asked Hamid
of a man who was sitting in front of the hut,
while two fine greyhounds lay beside him. "I
have brought a little friend with me who will
hunt with the falcons some day."</p>

<p>"May it be soon," said the thin, wiry Bedouin,
rising and drawing the curtain of the
hut. "The old ones are impatient to be flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the wind, and I would teach the young ones
something more."</p>

<p>This man was Awad, the old falconer, the
man who trains falcons, who was only too proud
to show off his household of fine birds. These
hawk-like birds, called falcons, are great hunters
of small game; and can be trained to hunt
for their masters, just as one can train a dog.
The falcon drops down on its prey from above,
in a swift, straight line, and buries its sharp
claws in its back, often killing it before its master
comes up.</p>

<p>Hamid showed Rashid how he could make
his two handsome falcons come and sit on his
wrist and obey him. He could throw them off
into the air, and they would come back to him
when he whistled.</p>

<p>"Some day when thou art stronger, we will
go out with the falcons," said Hamid, as he put
the birds back on their perch.</p>

<p>When they left the hut, they saw Fatimah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
running toward them, a dear little gazelle
bounding along by her side.</p>

<p>"Isn't she beautiful?" said Fatimah, as
Rashid stroked the gazelle's dainty head. "I
think falcons are cruel because they chase these
pretty creatures. My little pet was caught by
the falcons; and, when father brought her
home, I begged him to give her to me for a
playmate. Now, more than ever, I do not like
to have the falcons chase these dear, gentle
little animals." Then she put her arms around
the gazelle's neck and hugged it.</p>

<p>When the children went back to the tent,
they found that the older folk had had their
siesta, or midday sleep, and were now sitting
in front of the tent.</p>

<p>Zubaydah had the supper-tray brought out to
the children; and, when they had again eaten,
while the men were sitting around smoking
their perfumed water-pipes, the full moon came
up over the ridge and made it almost as light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as day; for the moonlight of the desert seems
brighter than moonlight anywhere else because
the air is so clear.</p>

<p>Now they all began to tell stories and recite
poetry, of which the Arabs are very fond. The
Arab loves to hear and to tell stories about the
great deeds of their people in the past, and to
recite beautiful poems in praise of the glories
of many years ago.</p>

<p>Finally Fatimah brought out her lute, a queer
little instrument with only one string, which
did not make much music. But the song
was very pretty, and Fatimah sang it very
sweetly:</p>

<p>
"Oh, take these purple robes away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Give back my cloak of camel's hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And bear me from this tow'ring pile</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To where the 'Black Tents' flap the air.</span><br />
<br />
"The camel's colt with falt'ring tread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The dog that bays at all but me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Delight me more than ambling mules&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Than every art of minstrelsy."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>After the song, Rashid and Hamid rolled
themselves up in warm blankets in a corner of
the big tent and were soon asleep. So ended
Rashid's first day in the "Black Tents."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>HAMID AND RASHID AT PLAY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> little Rashid woke up the next morning,
he rubbed his eyes and for a moment wondered
if he was dreaming. It seemed so strange
to find himself lying in the corner of the big
tent instead of in his own room, with his pet
doves cooing at his window.</p>

<p>But instead of doves, what he heard was the
neighing and stamping of horses, and the calls
of the men driving the camels out to pasture.
As he turned his head, he found Hamid's
mother standing beside him with a bowl in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Here is warm milk from the camel," she
said, with a smile, "to make thee well and redden
thy cheeks. Hasten to drink it while it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
warm. There is water in yonder basin with
which to wash," she added.</p>

<p>Rashid was up in a minute, and dashed the
water over his face and hands. Then he made
his prayer like a good little Mohammedan that
he was, for he must do this before eating.</p>

<p>"I never tasted anything nicer than that,"
said he, as he finished his bowl of milk.</p>

<p>"'Tis good for thee to be hungry, for it
means that thou art already better," said little
Fatimah, wisely, giving him a piece of the cake
which had been baked the night before. She
had brought in her bowl to keep him company
at his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Where is Hamid?" asked Rashid, looking
around for his little friend.</p>

<p>"He has been in and out many times; but
I would not let him waken you," said Zubaydah.</p>

<p>"He is full of a secret that he will not tell
me," spoke up Fatimah, in rather a hurt voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Hamid poked his head in behind
the curtain of the tent in a great state of excitement.</p>

<p>"Come, Rashid," he said, "and tell me
what thou findest here."</p>

<p>Rashid ran at once out from the tent, and
there stood a fine little blooded Arabian horse,
all saddled and bridled.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a beautiful little horse!" exclaimed
Rashid.</p>

<p>"She only waits for her master," said a voice
behind him, and he turned to find Al-Abukar
smiling gravely.</p>

<p>"The horse is thine," he said. "She will
also help to bring strength to thy limbs, and
will carry thee like the wind across the plains
and hills."</p>

<p>Little Rashid was so astonished and happy
that he could not find words with which to
thank his kind friend for his gift, but he kissed
his hand and stammered out something. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he threw his arms about the pony's arched neck
and patted her delicate little nose. Oh, how
beautiful he thought the handsome red saddle
and bridle, with their silver buckles and red
tassels! There is no gift that pleases a little
Arab boy so much as a fine pony.</p>

<p>"Is she not a queen?" said Hamid, who was
as much pleased as his little friend. "I rode
with father to the tents of the great Sheik,
where one finds the best and swiftest horses;
and I helped to pick her out from dozens of
other ponies. She belongs to one of the five
great families, does she not, father?"</p>

<p>Hamid, like all little Arab boys, had been
taught to love horses, and to know the history
of the great breeds of Arabia as well as he did
that of his own tribe.</p>

<p>"Oh, she knows me already!" exclaimed
Rashid, with delight, as the pony rubbed her
little nose against his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"She looks lovely and haughty, like a little
Sultanah," he continued.</p>

<p>"What shall you call her?" asked Fatimah,
who was giving the pony a bit of her cake to
nibble.</p>

<p>"I will call her 'Sultanah,'" said Rashid,
as he clapped his hands; and everybody agreed
that the little horse could not have a better
name.</p>

<p>"Now you must feed her, Rashid, so that
she will know that she belongs to you," said
Hamid. "I will get some of the date bread."
He ran back quickly into the tent, and was back
again in a moment with a brown, sticky mass
in his hand, a kind of paste made of dried dates.
This Rashid fed to Sultanah, who seemed to
enjoy it very much.</p>

<p>"You must sometimes feed her meat, too;
that will make her strong and swift," added
Hamid, who was proud indeed to be able to
show that he knew all about Arabian ponies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our cousin who lives near the sea gives his
horses dried fish to eat," said Rashid.</p>

<p>"That may be well enough for some horses,"
replied Hamid, "but I give Zuleika dates and
milk and cakes. She eats what her master does.
Do you not, my beauty?" he said, stroking
Zuleika, who had just strolled up to make
friends with the newcomer.</p>

<p>Nothing would do but that Rashid must have
a ride at once; so Hamid saddled his pony, too,
and away went the two boys cantering swift and
sure in the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>"We will pass by the <i>madressah</i>, and let the
boys see how fine we are," said Hamid.</p>

<p>The <i>madressah</i> was a low shed made of
palm-branches where the little Bedouin boys
and girls went to school; for even in the desert
the children must study their lessons.</p>

<p>When Hamid and Rashid rode up, a number
of children were sitting around on the ground,
singing out their recitations at the top of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
voices, while the school-mistress sat outside
sewing.</p>

<p>But they forgot all about their lessons when
they spied the new boy, and ran out to greet
Rashid and ask him all sorts of questions; and
they patted and praised Sultanah and picked
out her good points in a very knowing way.</p>

<p>"Oh, thou truant!" said the school-mistress
to Hamid, "why art thou not at thy lessons?
Always thou hast thy head filled with
other things than thy books."</p>

<p>"Nay, teacher, be not cross; to-morrow we
will both come; and you will see that I shall
bring you a new pupil," said Hamid, as he and
Rashid rode away.</p>

<p>"Here is the place where the ponies are
kept," said Hamid, riding up to one side of
their tent. The boys jumped off their horses
and began to unsaddle.</p>

<p>"We will fasten Sultanah, for she is strange
yet to her new home," said Hamid, tying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pony's halter to one of the tent ropes. "But
Zuleika would never wander from this spot
where I place her until I bid her. She will
never let any one touch her but me; and, if a
stranger tried to mount her, he would soon find
himself lying in the dust.</p>

<p>"Zuleika does everything but talk," Hamid
went on, for he loved his horse as if she were
one of the family. "Sometimes, when the
nights are cold, she will come around to the
tent curtain and put her head inside and neigh,
and then I let her come inside and stand by
the fire."</p>

<p>"Now we will make '<i>kayf</i>' for awhile; for
thou hast rushed about enough for one hot
morning," said Hamid, throwing his saddle in
one corner of the big tent.</p>

<p>Making "<i>kayf</i>" is just a little Arab boy's
way of having a good time doing nothing at
all but lying on a rug in a cool corner of a tent,
or sitting in the shade of a palm-tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Rashid was not sorry to rest after the excitement
of the morning, so he curled up on one
of the mats and was fast asleep in a minute.</p>

<p>"Thou hast promised to show me the young
camels," whispered Rashid when Hamid had
finished pounding the coffee after the midday
meal.</p>

<p>"Come now, then," said Hamid. "Nassar-Ben
and his men guard the camel-colts down
by the stream."</p>

<p>The two boys went in and out among the
brown tents, jumping over the tent ropes rather
than taking the trouble to go around, until they
found the big herd of camels with a number
of baby camels. They were in the river valley,
where there was a good crop of coarse, high
grass called camel-grass, because it is so coarse
that nothing but a camel could eat it.</p>

<p>It was a great herd of camels, some of them
eating of the grass and others lying down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the shade; and all around were frisking numbers
of little baby camels.</p>

<p>Hamid's father was a Sheik, or captain of
a tribe of Bedouins, the real desert tribes of
Arabs, who live only in tents in an oasis of the
desert.</p>

<p>They had pitched their tents in this particular
spot because of its being a very suitable
one in which to pasture their camels. The sole
wealth of a Bedouin is his flocks and herds and
his horse and his firearms; and, of course, his
tent and his few simple belongings.</p>

<p>Some of the Sheiks raise horses, others sheep,
and others camels. The people of Hamid's
tribe lived by raising and selling camels to their
neighbours who did not raise them, or to the
merchants in the cities and towns.</p>

<p>"Don't baby camels look as if they would
break in two?" said Rashid, as they came up
to a group of young camels, "their legs are
so long and thin."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father is going to take some of the colts
to sell to the great Sheik who has the fine
horses. Perhaps he will let us go with him,"
said Hamid. "I heard Nassar-Ben tell him
last night that the young camels were now
strong enough for the journey.</p>

<p>"Nassar-Ben is our camel-sheik; and he and
his men guard the herd. There he sits in the
shadow of the tent, and those are his children
scrambling around and playing on that old
camel's back," continued Hamid, bound that
his little friend should know all about everything.</p>

<p>"Wait, oh, babies! I can mount quicker
than that," shouted Hamid to Nassar-Ben's
children, who were amusing themselves climbing
over the back of one of the old camels.</p>

<p>"Look! This is the way to mount a camel,"
said Hamid, as he climbed up one of the legs
of a big camel as if it were a tree-trunk; and,
finally, throwing his leg over the beast's neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he was soon perched on the hump in the middle
of the camel's back.</p>

<p>"Come up, come up, that's the stairway!"
he called to Rashid.</p>

<p>"Oh, I daren't," cried poor little Rashid,
slipping back as he tried to hold on to the camel's
rusty knee.</p>

<p>"You will learn in time, my little master,"
said Nassar-Ben, lifting him up beside Hamid.
Then all the other little children swarmed up
the old camel's legs; and, when the camel man
gave her a blow with a stick, away she went,
the children laughing and holding on to each
other to keep from slipping off. Suddenly the
old camel wheeled around and started back at
a gallop. Little Rashid had ridden on a camel
before, but never on a bare-back camel in that
fashion. The first thing he knew he was lying
in the dust, together with one of the little
Bedouin boys, whom he had pulled off with
him as he fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>



<p>"Oh!" said the little boy, half-crying, "you
made me fall off on purpose!" He felt so
badly that he, one of the boys of the camel-sheik,
should have been seen to fall from a
camel that he began to thump Rashid as hard
as he could.</p>

<p>"Fie! for shame!" cried Hamid, rushing
up to them as he jumped down from the camel.
"Is this the way to treat a stranger and a guest
in our tents?"</p>

<p>The little boy stopped at once and hung his
head, looking very much ashamed; for he knew
how wrong it was to be rude to a guest.</p>

<p>"This greenhorn from the town made me
fall, and they jeered at me," he said, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Nay, but I did not mean to pull you off,"
said Rashid; "thou must blame the steep hump
of the camel." He looked so sorry that the
little fellow stopped frowning at once. They
made friends again, and all ran back for another
ride on the camel, while Rashid made up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
his mind that he would learn to climb and
mount a camel all by himself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i046.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="family in front of tents" />
<div class="caption">IN THE BLACK TENTS.</div>
</div>

<p>After a few days, Rashid's father had to
go home, and Rashid had quite a lump in his
throat as he sat on Sultanah one morning and
watched his father's little caravan pass out of
sight over the ridge. He would not have cried
for anything, however; and, when he thought
of his good friends here in the "Black Tents"
and his little pony and the good times he was
to have, he felt better.</p>

<p>What with drinking camel's milk and galloping
over the plain on Sultanah's back, Rashid
soon began to grow strong and well. His little
white face changed to a healthy brown colour.</p>

<p>Rashid and Hamid helped the falconer look
after his birds, and Awad, their keeper, showed
them how to train a falcon oneself.</p>

<p>One day as the boys were sitting under the
shadow of a group of big palm-trees playing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sort of "jack-straw" game with date seeds for
stones, Rashid suddenly exclaimed: "What
can that be?" A sudden flash of light had
made his eyes blink, and straightway there was
another. "Who is playing tricks?" said
Hamid, looking around. Then they heard a
low laugh, and there was Fatimah behind a
tree, holding a little looking-glass in her hand
so that it would flash a ray of sunlight right
in the boys' eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you monkey! Where did you get that
glass, and who is this stranger?" asked Hamid;
for he had just spied another little girl's
head peeping over Fatimah's shoulder.</p>

<p>"There is a merchant at the great tent. He
is Hajj and this is his little granddaughter;
and, oh! he has such beautiful things to sell,
mirrors like this and silks and jewelry and&mdash;but
you should see them yourselves!" said
Fatimah without stopping for breath.</p>

<p>Hamid did not need to be told the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
time. It was a great event in the lives of the
desert children whenever a travelling merchant
came; for this was the only chance they ever
had to buy anything whatever known to the
town dwellers.</p>

<p>The children found the old merchant opening
up his saddle-bags and spreading his wares
on a rug in front of the tent, while everybody
crowded around to look at the velvet purses,
the silk veils, and trinkets of all kinds as
well as weapons and firearms which he displayed.</p>

<p>What caught Hamid's eyes first were the
long pistols with funny curved handles set with
mother-of-pearl and silver.</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" he said, "thou hast promised
me a new pistol! You remember; it was
when I shot to the centre of the mark a month
ago."</p>

<p>"Ah, thou hast a good memory; but thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
mother wants a silken veil and Fatimah some
gewgaws," said old Al-Abukar.</p>

<p>"Here is a fine pistol which will just suit
the little Sheik," said the old merchant, taking
from his own belt a fine weapon, all set with
pearl and silver. "This was made for the son
of a great prince; but it came to me in the
course of trade and it is a gift that will make
the boy glad."</p>

<p>"Oh, father! What a beautiful weapon!
It will be a long time before one sees such another,"
exclaimed Hamid, as he handled the
weapon lovingly.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said his father, "a promise is
a promise; and one might as well spend the
money now as at another time." Then he
began to unroll the long sash around his waist,
so that he could get at his leather belt in which
he kept his money.</p>

<p>Wasn't Hamid a proud boy when he stuck
the pistol in his sash and strolled up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in front of the other boys. They were all envious,
too, in a proper way; for it was not
every one who could carry a pistol made for
a prince.</p>

<p>"Now let us see what thy new pistol will
do," said Al-Abukar, taking a coin from his
pouch, and, through a hole in it, attaching a
string and suspending it from the end of a pole
which projected from one side of the tent. He
paced backwards a short distance, and told
Hamid to stand on that spot and shoot at the
string which held the coin and try to cut it with
the bullet from his pistol.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, thou hast given me a hard
task," said Hamid, as he took his place and
began to load his pistol.</p>

<p>"So much the more honour to you if you
do it well, then," replied his father. "Aim
carefully and not too high," he continued.</p>

<p>Hamid shot at the coin several times, but
with no luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let Rashid try his skill," said Al-Abukar.</p>

<p>Rashid's hand shook as he took aim, and his
first shot went wild; but his second just grazed
the coin and sent it swinging to and fro like
a pendulum.</p>

<p>"Well done! oh, son of the city!" cried
out the children from the other tents, who had
crowded around to watch the shooting.</p>

<p>Their praise pleased Rashid, for he had
practised hard with Hamid at shooting at a
mark since he had been in the desert.</p>

<p>"I will do it this time," said Hamid, as he
set his teeth. Again, however, he only sent
the dust flying about an astonished camel, who
just at that moment poked his inquisitive nose
out from behind the tent.</p>

<p>"Enough powder and shot has been wasted
for one day," said Al-Abukar, raising his pistol;
"we will take the coin down." Then, firing
at the cord with a sure and steady aim, he cut
it as if with a knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not the fault of the new pistol," said
Al-Abukar, smiling at Hamid, who looked very
disappointed. "Never mind, thou wilt succeed
better another time," he added.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE ROBBER BAND AND AN OSTRICH HUNT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Fatimah was making friends
with Nawara, the old merchant's little granddaughter.
She was a wild, shy little girl, wearing
a dark blue cotton dress, a mass of tangled
black hair hanging down on her shoulders. The
hot sun and the wind had burnt her face almost
black. She was telling Fatimah of her long
journeys with her grandfather.</p>

<p>"Thou art a great traveller," said Fatimah,
looking at the little girl in round-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father and mother are dead," she
said, "and, as I have no little brothers or sisters,
I go always with grandfather. He makes
a nice seat for me on top of the big bales of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
goods on the camel's back, or he holds me before
him on his dromedary."</p>

<p>"And art thou never afraid?" asked Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Sometimes, though, at night,
when I hear the jackals howling near our tent,
I pull the rug up over my head. But when we
come to the 'Black Tents' every one is so kind.
I find many little playmates; and often they
want me to stay with them. Grandfather
would miss me sadly if I did," said Nawara,
with an important air. "When we halt I
always gather the dry thorns and make the
fire, and melt the milk balls to make a cool
drink while the cakes are cooking," she went
on.</p>

<p>"Thou art indeed quite a little woman,"
said Fatimah's mother, smiling at the little
girl's talk.</p>

<p>"'Tis good to be here," said the merchant,
after his other customers had gone and the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had gathered for the evening meal in front
of the tent. "We came a long, weary way
to-day. I feared to stop by the road, for there
was talk of robbers hiding in the hills, and a
party of travellers had been attacked by them
a few days ago."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we will see them to-morrow,
father, and then I will have a chance to use
my new pistol," spoke up Hamid, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The rascals give no one a chance to see
them. They keep themselves safely hid behind
the rocks, and fire upon the peaceful traveller
before he is aware that they are there," the
merchant replied.</p>

<p>"It is their way," said Al-Abukar. "I
would not hasten thy going," he continued;
"but if thou wilt join our party we will ride
together as far as the tents of our friends. It
will be safer for thee and the little one as well
as thy goods," said the Sheik.</p>

<p>So it was arranged that the old merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and Nawara should start out with them the
next day.</p>

<p>Hamid and Rashid lay awake half the night,
planning what they would do if they met the
robbers; and they were up and had saddled
their horses while it was yet starlight, so as to
get a good start before the heat of the day
came down upon them.</p>

<p>The camel men were ready with the camels
tied together in a long line, one behind the
other, so that they might not stray apart.</p>

<p>The old merchant seated himself cross-legged
on his dromedary, which is much like a camel
except that it is swifter and has two humps
on its back instead of one.</p>

<p>"Thou hast been very kind," said little Nawara,
putting her arms around Fatimah and
kissing her as they were leaving.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt come again some day, perhaps,"
said Zubaydah, the mother. "Meantime here
is something to keep thee from having to cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the midday meal," she said, as she stuffed some
fresh dates and cakes into the food-bags.</p>

<p>Now the men started the camels, Al-Abukar
and the boys swung themselves into their saddles,
and away they galloped.</p>

<p>Hamid looked very fine indeed, for a little
Bedouin boy likes to look at his best when he
is making his first visit. He had put on his
long white cloak of camel's-hair cloth, and
thrown over his white cap a silk cloth like a
large handkerchief with long red tassels at the
corners. This was held on by a cord of brown
wool wound round and round his head. In the
broad silken sash at his waist was stuck a small
dagger with a curved blade and of course the
new pistol, and his jacket was embroidered with
a silver thread.</p>

<p>Rashid, too, was dressed in Bedouin style;
and each of the boys carried a spear, while they
had polished as brightly as possible the silver
buckles and ornaments on their bridles and saddles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
To the boys' great disappointment nothing
happened and they reached the tents of
their friends safely enough. Here they spent
three happy days.</p>

<p>While Al-Abukar and his friend the Sheik
bargained over the prices of the colts, Hamid
and Rashid played with the children of the
encampment, riding races on horseback and
having a good time generally. Indeed they
were sorry when they came to say good-bye,
and turned their horses' heads homewards.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there are any robbers, after
all," said Rashid to Hamid, as they were riding
back together a little ahead of the party.</p>

<p>"They are only men from the mountains,
anyway," said Hamid, with a toss of his head,
a Bedouin's way of saying he didn't think much
of their bravery.</p>

<p>"Some of them are courageous enough,"
said one of the camel men who had just come
up behind them; "and this is just the sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a place they would choose to lurk in," he continued,
looking carefully about him as they
entered a ravine between the hills.</p>

<p>Just as the camel man had finished speaking,
Hamid looked up and saw a curl of white
smoke coming out from behind a rock on the
hillside above them.</p>

<p>"Down!" cried Hamid, pushing Rashid
forward on his pony's neck and at the same
time throwing himself flat on Zuleika's neck
just as a bullet went whizzing over their heads.</p>

<p>"'Tis they! the rascals! They are skulking
behind the rocks, and will not come out and
fight in the open like brave men," cried Al-Abukar,
galloping up furiously and sending a
shot back in the direction from which they had
been attacked.</p>

<p>"Give your horses their rein, boys, and ride
on as fast as ever you can. These worthless
fellows will have no horses that can overtake
yours. I will teach the brigands what it means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to fire on a Bedouin chief." So saying, Al-Abukar
dashed straight up the rocky side of the
ravine.</p>

<p>"I will not flee! I will follow you, father!"
cried Hamid, spurring Zuleika on close behind
his father's horse. Rashid followed, not knowing
what might happen, but determined to stay
by Hamid at any cost.</p>

<p>The horses needed no spur, for the sound of
the shot had made them wild, and they bounded
up the steep rocky trail like gazelles.</p>

<p>The band of robbers were so taken aback at
this sudden return of their attack that they fled
without a parting shot, but not before Al-Abukar
had captured their chief.</p>

<p>"Aha! Thy beard is now in my grasp,"
said Al-Abukar to the robber chief, as he and
his men fastened their prisoner on the back of
one of the camels.</p>

<p>"Thou didst not think any one could reach
thee on that steep mountainside, but thou didst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
not reckon on the mettle of the horses of our
tribe."</p>

<p>"Look you," said the camel man, as he rode
up alongside the boys again, "it was a good
thing that you sheltered yourselves behind your
horses' necks. Here, Rashid, is the hole of the
bullet right through this head-kerchief of yours,
and if you had not pulled your little friend
down on to his horse's neck as you were riding
beside him, Hamid, the bullet would certainly
have gone straight through his head."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hamid, you have saved my life," said
Rashid, turning pale for the first time. He had
been too much excited before to be frightened.</p>

<p>"He only did his duty to his friend," Al-Abukar
replied, gravely; but Hamid saw by
his look that he was proud of his son. He sat
up a little straighter in his saddle and felt that
he had grown at least a couple of inches taller
during the morning.</p>

<p>"Thou hast disobeyed me, child, but I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
scold thee," continued his father; "for you
and Rashid both followed me like brave little
sons of the desert."</p>

<p>"But, father!" said Hamid, clutching at
Zuleika's rein, suddenly, "I forgot all about
firing my new pistol!" At this they all laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said his father; "I am sorry
to say there are still many robbers left, and that
you may yet have a chance to use it."</p>

<p>When they rode up to the tents with their
prisoner, the robber chief, every one hurrahed;
and the mother and Fatimah had, of course,
to hear all about the adventures at once.</p>

<p>"Shall we go out to-day, my young masters,
and see if we can bring home some hares for
our dinner, or perhaps catch a grouse or two?"
asked Awad, the falconer, when Hamid and
Rashid came to look at the birds on the morning
after the adventure with the robbers.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" cried both the boys in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
breath; and it was not long before they were
speeding over the plain beside Awad, with the
two greyhounds leaping along after them.</p>

<p>Awad carried his falcon, and Hamid had his
own bird, too, perched on his wrist. Every
now and then the boys, out of sheer fun, would
throw their spears up in the air and catch them
again as they were riding furiously across the
plain. This is quite a feat, as you may imagine,
when one is riding at full speed, but Hamid
could do it easily. His spear was a long bamboo
cane with a brass tip on one end, and on
the other an iron spear sharpened so that it
could be stuck upright in the ground if need
be. Next to his pony and his pistol, Hamid
was more fond of his spear than of any other
of his belongings; and he could not be induced
to part with it at any time.</p>

<p>Over the rocky, sandy ground they rode, and
through thickets of acacia and mimosa trees.
Just as they came out into the open again there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was a whirr, and up rose a bevy of birds just
in front of them.</p>

<p>"Now is thy chance! Whistle off thy falcon!"
cried Awad.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Hamid threw off his falcon
from his wrist, and like a dart it swept after the
fleeing birds.</p>

<p>"Ho! my beauty, faster! faster! faster!"
cried Hamid, and, patting his pony's neck, he
flew along, with Rashid close behind.</p>

<p>"She gains on them!" cried Rashid. Just
then the falcon with a shrill cry came up with
the poor bird it had been chasing, as it fluttered
to the ground tired out; and, fixing its great
talons in the feathers of its back, carried it
toward Hamid.</p>

<p>"Well done!" cried Awad, as Hamid rode
up to him, glowing with pride. "Thou art
indeed an apt pupil, and some day will excel
thy teacher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"But thou didst not throw off thy own falcon,"
said Hamid.</p>

<p>"Nay, I wanted you to have all the glory
this time," answered Awad, with a smile.
"But now comes my turn," he exclaimed, as
he sent his falcon flying after some hares which
were scuttling along the ground to their holes.
The greyhounds bounded after the frightened
little animals; but, though they are the swiftest
dogs known, the old falcon which Awad had
been carrying on his wrist was faster than they.
He caught up with the hares before they did
and pounced upon one of them.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was high above the
horizon; and the very air seemed quivering,
it was so hot.</p>

<p>"We will stop now and have something to
eat, this seems a likely place," said the old falconer,
as they halted under a tree. The boys
declared they were quite ready, and vaulted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
once from their horses; for they had eaten
only a bit of dry bread before starting out.</p>

<p>"Thrust your spear into the ground, Rashid,
as I have mine," said Hamid; "and we will
make a tent under which to rest, by hanging
Awad's great cloak between them."</p>

<p>"Look, Hamid, what a pretty round, white
stone I have found here," called out Rashid,
as the end of his lance struck something hard
in the sand.</p>

<p>"Stone!" said Hamid, brushing the sand
away. "It's an ostrich's egg, and here is another;
why, it's an ostrich's nest!"</p>

<p>"Oh, and to think that I found it!" cried
Rashid. He had seen the eggs for sale in the
bazaars of Medina, and knew that the ostriches
bury their eggs in the hot sand, which hatches
them out in time; but he had hardly hoped to
be able to ever find a real ostrich's nest himself.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Awad, as he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
up from hobbling the horses. "Ostrich eggs!
Then likely enough the bird itself is not far
off," he continued, looking around.</p>

<p>"Yes, there she is," cried Hamid, pointing
to a spot some distance away. Sure enough,
there was the ostrich, with its head buried in
the sand.</p>

<p>"Foolish bird! she thinks that as long as
she hides her head in the sand, and cannot see
us, that we are not able to see her, and that
she is safely hidden from danger. Come, let
us give chase," said Awad, running back to the
horses. So, forgetting the heat and their hunger,
the boys jumped on their horses again,
while the greyhounds, hot on the scent, led the
chase after the big bird.</p>

<p>The ostrich apparently heard them coming
and got her head out of the sand quickly
enough. And did not the long-legged bird give
them a chase, covering yards of ground at each
step!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is throwing stones at us," laughed
Hamid, as the bird's big feet sent a shower of
small stones flying back at them.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I only had a stout rope with me,"
said Awad.</p>

<p>"It is here," said the black servant who had
accompanied them, drawing a coil from his
saddle-bag and throwing it to Awad as they all
galloped onward.</p>

<p>But if the bird was swift, so were the others,
too; and, as the greyhounds gained on her, the
ostrich grew bewildered until finally she turned
at bay and showed fight.</p>

<p>"Beware!" shouted Awad, as he caught Zuleika's
bridle and reined her back just as the
bird lifted her great foot to strike at Hamid.
"A blow from her foot would be a dangerous
thing," he continued. At the same time he
threw a noose of rope and skilfully entangled
the ostrich's foot just as one of the greyhounds
sprang at the bird. After many struggles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ostrich was thrown and secured in spite of its
vicious kicks.</p>

<p>Awad sent the servant in hot haste back to
the tents to fetch help to get the ostrich home;
for it is no easy matter to manage one of these
great strong birds, even after you have got it
well secured.</p>

<p>At last our little hunting-party had a chance
to rest; and, while they ate their dried dates
and cakes, the boys talked of nothing but their
ostrich hunt. Rashid was sure that this was
the most wonderfully interesting day he had
ever spent.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>RASHID GOES HOME</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> time Awad had trained the ostrich so
well that the children could play with her as
they did with the camels and ponies.</p>

<p>One day there was a great laughing and
shouting around the tents. No wonder! for
there came the ostrich stalking along with
Hamid and Rashid on her back. Hamid sat
astride the bird's neck, guiding it by a rope
which was tied around its head for a bridle.</p>

<p>"Let me get up, too," cried Fatimah, who
came running out of the tent; and good-natured
Awad swung her up beside the boys.</p>

<p>"Hold on tight," he called out, as away
went the big bird with a troop of little Bedouin
children following a long way after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Such a ride as the children had! Poor Awad
was quite breathless when they got back, from
running to keep up with the bird's long strides.</p>

<p>But now Rashid's happy days in the desert
were coming to an end; for the time had come
when he must leave the "Black Tents" and
go home. He was well and strong now, and
a messenger had come from his father, saying
how much he missed his boy, and how all at
home wanted to have him back again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rashid, must you go?" asked Hamid,
who felt very sad at losing his little
friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, but my father has sent word that
you must come back with me, Hamid, for a
visit with us."</p>

<p>And so it was all arranged that not only
Hamid was to go with Rashid, but all the
family as well. Everybody was very busy
making preparations.</p>

<p>There were a great many things to do in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
order to get ready for the journey, for when
a Bedouin travels he takes his house and all
his belongings with him.</p>

<p>Long before the peep of day Nassar-Ben
had his great camels kneeling before the tents,
and the camel men began to fasten the loads
on the camels' backs, the beasts were groaning
and moaning as they always do when they are
being loaded. Camels are very cunning and
wise, and try to make out that they have already
too much to carry, even before they have
made the attempt. Every once and awhile they
would get up, and the camel men would cry
out to them to kneel down again and keep
quiet, giving a sharp blow with the curved
stick which the drivers always carry to guide
the camels.</p>

<p>One of the camels carried a litter in which
Fatimah and her mother were to ride. It
was like a broad seat and long enough so
that Zubaydah and Fatimah might use it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a bed to lie down upon as well. Arched over
it were poles on which hung curtains to keep
out the dust and sun.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="group of people on camel" />
<div class="caption">IN THE "<i>SHUGDUF</i>."</div>
</div>

<p>"Isn't this nice and snug?" laughed Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Too snug when all of you little ones are
here," answered her mother.</p>

<p>The children had all climbed up into the litter
to see just what it was like; and, of course,
they had got in the way of Zubaydah who
was hanging the pouches or bags around inside
the curtains. These contained the food
and other necessaries for the journey.</p>

<p>"It is very well for thee, Fatimah, but I
am glad I am going to ride Zuleika," said Hamid,
slipping out and stopping to watch two
men swing two large jars of water across the
camel's back behind the litter, which the Arabs
called the "<i>shugduf</i>."</p>

<p>All the little Bedouin children of the neighbourhood
crowded around to bid Rashid good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for they had grown very fond of him and
were sorry to see him go. Each had brought
him some little parting gift, such as a string
of dates, a bunch of feathers for his spear, or
a tame bird.</p>

<p>After Rashid had thanked his kind little
friends, there was great fun stowing the presents
away so that they might be carried safely,
especially the shell of one of the ostrich's eggs
which Awad had brought him. Finally Fatimah
found a place for this last gift by putting
it in a palm-leaf basket and hanging it from
the roof of the "<i>shugduf</i>."</p>

<p>At last all was ready. The boys mounted
their ponies and the camel men cried out orders
to the great beasts, and the camels got up
slowly, groaning under their big loads. Al-Abukar
looked splendid as he rode at the head
of the little caravan on his swift dromedary.
Over the dromedary's back were two big saddle-bags
with long crimson tassels which hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
nearly down to the ground; the saddle itself
was of red leather with a high metal pommel
at the front and back. Beside the dromedary
cantered the two boys.</p>

<p>Rashid turned around and waved a last
good-bye with his spear to all his friends
whom he had left behind at the encampment,
while all the little Bedouins ran after him a
little way, shouting at the tops of their voices:
"May your shadow never grow less, O little
Son of the Walls!"</p>

<p>Soon the "Black Tents" were left far behind,
and the camels struck into their regular
caravan gait, rolling and lurching like a ship
at sea.</p>

<p>If you were riding a camel for the first time
you would understand why the Arabs call the
camel "the ship of the desert," for it rolls
backwards and forwards and pitches first forward
and then backward exactly like a ship in
mid-ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>At noon they halted for the midday meal.
While the men hastily put up a tent, the children
gathered dry branches in the thickets of
thorn-bushes with which to make the fire.
Meanwhile Hamid had spied some tents in the
distance; and, near them, a woman tending
goats.</p>

<p>"May we go and ask her to give us some
milk, mother?" asked Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Yes, and here is some bread to give her
in exchange for the milk," said Zubaydah.</p>

<p>The Bedouin woman gladly filled the bowl
that the children brought with them with nice
warm goat's milk, but when Fatimah offered
her the bread, she shook her head angrily.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, I am not a '<i>labban</i>,'"&mdash;a
milk-seller,&mdash;she said. The true Bedouins
think it is a disgrace to sell milk, and that it
is only right that they should give it freely to
any stranger who may ask for it.</p>

<p>When the children got back with the milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Zubaydah was frying dates in butter, and soon
they were all sitting in the shade of the tent
eating heartily of them and the cold meat and
rice and cakes.</p>

<p>"The camels are glad to rest, too," said
Rashid, watching them as they slowly knelt
down one by one. It is one of the funniest
sights in the world to see a camel lay down on
the ground. He sighs and groans and slowly
unbends his funny long legs that look as if
they would come unjointed and drop off. He
folds up his fore legs a little, then he folds
up his hind legs in part, and then he falls on
his knees until his nose nearly touches the
ground. Now he finishes the folding up process
with all his legs, as if they were the blades
of a jack-knife, and tucks them well away
beneath him.</p>

<p>When it became cooler our party broke
camp, and the little caravan started off again
over the desert. They passed more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
tents and herds, and also a little party of travellers
like themselves, and all shouted <i>salaams</i>,
or greetings, as they went by.</p>

<p>When they stopped for their supper, Hamid
and Rashid, instead of washing themselves as
usual, poured sand over their faces and hands
in place of water. This is the Mohammedan
custom when travelling in the desert, for where
water has to be carried with one, it must not
be wasted.</p>

<p>When bedtime came the children were quite
ready for it, for it had been a long, hard day.
Fatimah said she would rather sleep in the
tent; but the two boys rolled themselves up
in their rugs on the warm sand outside, and,
with their saddles for pillows, slept as soundly
as did their ponies, who were tethered beside
them.</p>

<p>"Fasten the curtains of the litter well," said
Al-Abukar when the little party started off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the next day, "the 'poison-wind' has begun
to blow."</p>

<p>"Ugh! and it is as hot as if it blew from
a furnace," said Hamid, tying the end of his
kerchief tightly across his mouth. Rashid did
the same, while Fatimah helped her mother to
draw the curtains tightly around them; for the
<i>simoon</i>, as this great desert wind is called, was
blowing great whirls of sand into their faces.</p>

<p>"Here comes a thing of ill-omen," said Hamid's
father, pointing to a great column of
sand which whirled by them at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>"Ay, it is a <i>genie</i>, the evil spirit of the desert,"
muttered the old camel-sheik, wrapping
his cloak more closely about him.</p>

<p>The <i>genie</i> is practically a pillar of sand
drawn up into the air by the wind as it whirls
and blows around and around with a circular
motion, very much in the same way that a
water-spout is formed at sea. The Arabs are
all afraid of the <i>genie</i>, and say it is an evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
spirit; and no wonder, for these moving columns
of sand do not look unlike some strange,
living thing as they go dancing across the
desert.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing so hard when they
halted at midday that they could not think of
putting up a tent or cooking; but ate as best
they could huddled up beside the kneeling camels,
with their cloaks pulled up over their
heads.</p>

<p>"I am eating more sand than bread," said
Hamid, with disgust, as he held tightly to his
cloak to keep it wrapped closely about him,
and tried to eat at the same time.</p>

<p>"I know I must have eaten a basketful,"
said Rashid.</p>

<p>"Oh, there goes my veil," cried Fatimah,
who had thoughtlessly popped her head out of
the litter.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt never see it again," said her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
mother. Almost immediately it had been lost
to view as it went sailing through the air.</p>

<p>"Never mind, thou shalt buy the prettiest
that can be found in the Bazaar when we get
to the city," said her father, consolingly.</p>

<p>The little caravan struggled against the
wind all the rest of the day; and that night
there was no sleeping in a tent for anybody.
The next day, however, things went better.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see over there a beautiful lake of
blue water and palm-trees beside it," cried
Fatimah. "Look, mother," she said, waking
her mother from a doze and pointing across
the sandy plain.</p>

<p>"Indeed it looks as though there were
water and trees ahead," said her mother; but
Al-Abukar answered: "Nay, it is but a <i>mirage</i>."</p>

<p>"But we can see the ripple of the water;
it must be real," persisted Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the camel man, and shielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
his eyes with his hand, he peered at the strange
sight. "The camels say nothing," he continued,
"and they are wise and can always tell
when water is near. If it were real water
they would begin to whine and groan." Sure
enough, as they went toward the <i>mirage</i>, it
faded away altogether, the lake, trees, and all.</p>

<p>"But it did look real, did it not, father?"
said Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Ah, so has thought many a poor traveller
to his undoing, when he was lost in the desert
and was dying of thirst," answered her father.
"He thinks he sees cool water and green trees
ahead of him, and hurries along to reach them,
only to find that the mocking <i>mirage</i> has faded
away and that there is nothing there but the
hot sand of the desert."</p>

<p>A <i>mirage</i> really is nothing more than a sort
of reflection of some very distant object projected
into the sky through the hot, dry air
of the desert. Sometimes the desert traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sees a phantom city in the clouds, and sometimes
a ship, as if it were floating on the sandy
waves of the desert instead of on the ocean;
but it is all a delusion and not real.</p>

<p>From now on, the little Bedouins began to
remark that they were leaving the desert behind
them. They began to pass some houses,
and then small villages of mud huts with roofs
of palm-leaves. Around these villages were
little fields divided off by low ridges of earth.
There were orchards of fruit-trees, and Hamid
and Rashid rode up to one of these and bought
some pomegranates.</p>

<p>"Did ever anything taste nicer?" said
Fatimah. And they all agreed with her as
they ate the sweet, pink pomegranate seeds.</p>

<p>Soon they were riding through great groves
of date-palms, and shortly caught a glimpse of
the city shining white through the trees still
some distance away.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hamid! I believe that is my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
yonder," cried Rashid, as he caught sight of
several horsemen riding toward them.</p>

<p>It was true; it was the Sharif, Rashid's
father, who, with a party of relatives, had
come out to meet them. Rashid galloped forward,
and in another moment was in the arms
of his father.</p>

<p>The caravan came to a halt, and, after many
greetings on all sides, got under way again,
and they all rode together into the city.</p>

<p>"Is not the big city a wonderful place?"
whispered little Fatimah to her mother as they
rode through the great city gates of stone, the
walls of which were painted with broad bands
of yellow and red. She had never before seen
a large city.</p>

<p>"Keep clear of the sides, O camel men!"
shouted out Nassar-Ben, who had hard work
guiding his little caravan through the narrow,
winding streets. The camel men had to run
behind their charges, prodding them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sticks and crying out: "Go in the middle of
the road! O! Hé! O! Hi!"</p>

<p>Finally they came to the great square called
the "Kneeling Place of the Camels," because
all the caravans which came into the city were
obliged to unload or encamp there. On one
side of the square was the house in which
Rashid lived. "Welcome to our house," said
the Sharif, as he led his friends through a
gateway and into a large courtyard.</p>

<p>Here they dismounted. Rashid's mother
and his big brother, Ali, and all the other
relations and servants rushed out to meet them.
And wasn't Rashid glad to see them all again!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>HAMID AND FATIMAH SEE THE GREAT CITY</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> is that?" asked Hamid, who was
awakened in the morning by the sound of a
voice shouting, "Great is Allah!" He and
Rashid were sleeping on the roof of the house,
as city Arabs often do in the hot weather.</p>

<p>"That is the 'Muezzin,'" replied Rashid.
"Come to the parapet and you can see him."</p>

<p>Rashid pointed to a tall, slender tower not
far away. Near the top was a small balcony,
on which a man was standing. He calls out
these words every day at sunrise and sunset to
remind the people that they must not forget
to say their prayers. In a monotonous sing-song
voice he calls: "Great is Allah! there is
no God but Allah and Mohammed is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Prophet." When the people hear this cry,
they rise and say their prayers, always looking
toward Mecca, the Holy City.</p>

<p>Hamid could see five of these long needle-like
towers or minarets, and a great green
dome, rising above the tree-tops not far away.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i093.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="two children scattering grain" />
<div class="caption">"THEY SCATTERED THE GRAIN ALL ABOUT THE COURTYARD."</div>
</div>

<p>"That is the great Mosque," said Rashid;
"and we are going there to-day because&mdash;"
but he got no further, for just at that moment
a dozen or more pigeons came flying about
him, fluttering their wings on his face and
perching on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, what pretty birds! How tame they
are!" said Hamid, stroking the smooth wings
of one of the white doves.</p>

<p>"They are my pets," said Rashid. "They
come every morning to be fed. Let us give
them their breakfasts." Leading the way to
the storeroom on the ground floor, he filled
a basket with grain which he took from one
of the great bags which were always stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
there. Then they scattered the grain all about
the courtyard in the centre of the house, to the
great delight of the pigeons.</p>

<p>The little Bedouins were eager to see the
city; and, of course, the first place that Rashid
showed his friends was the great Mosque, as
their church was called.</p>

<p>It was the same where Hamid had seen the
"Muezzin" in the tower. This Mosque is
very sacred to the Arabs, and they visit it at
every opportunity, because it is the tomb of
the great Arab Prophet Mohammed. When
they reached the Mosque, they left their slippers
outside, and, after saying a prayer or two,
Rashid showed Hamid and Fatimah around
the great building.</p>

<p>After this they walked down the long street
that led from the Mosque to the great City
Gate. Here were gathered all the shops.
Such funny little shops! Nothing but little
rickety wooden booths thatched with palm-leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and very dingy and dirty. However,
they contained many wonderful and curious
things. The children marvelled at them all.
There were great strings and bunches of pink,
red, and white coral that is found on the rocks
in the Red Sea, and there were ornaments and
jewelry made of mother-of-pearl; as well as
many kinds of strange weapons, whose handles
were inlaid with pieces of this same glittering
shell.</p>

<p>"Just look at that lamp," said Hamid,
"made from an ostrich's egg," as he stopped
before one of the booths where the shells of
the eggs of these big birds had been mounted
in brass and silver and made into hanging-lamps,
pipe-bowls, and vases.</p>

<p>Fatimah was very happy. She had found
a booth where she could buy a pretty rose-coloured
veil to replace the one she had lost
in the desert.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the big City Gate a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of children were sitting weaving baskets
and mats of palm-leaves.</p>

<p>"How easily she does it," said Fatimah,
as they stood watching one of the little girls
plait the long strips of dry leaves into a pretty
basket.</p>

<p>By the time our little party had walked up
and down the long line of shops many times,
they were quite ready to go home and rest in
the balcony of the "<i>majlis</i>," or parlour of the
house. The children soon found that this balcony
was a very cosy nook in which to sit because
it hung out over the street, so that they
might easily see everything which went on in
the big, lively square.</p>

<p>The "<i>majlis</i>" itself, which extended back
into the house, was a great big, bare room with
a divan of cushions around the walls and a
large rug covering the floor in the centre.
There was no furniture except a low table in
the middle, on which were the hubble-bubble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
pipes and a brass tray which held the coffee-pot
and cups. High up on the wall hung some
swords and guns well out of the reach of the
little folks.</p>

<p>Some days later Hamid was kneeling in the
"<i>majlis</i>" balcony and peeping out through the
carved wooden lattice which enclosed the balcony
on the street side, while Fatimah stood
behind him looking over his shoulder. Suddenly
Rashid put his head in at the door and
exclaimed: "I have been looking everywhere
for thee."</p>

<p>"Just come and look out on the square,
Rashid; it is full of people and camels and
horses, and tents are being put up all over it,"
called out Hamid.</p>

<p>"It is the big caravan that comes from
Damascus. They are the pilgrims on their
way to the Holy City," said Rashid, joining
them on the balcony. "I was looking everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for thee to tell thee of it. Father says
there are many thousands of the pilgrims."</p>

<p>Such a bustle and scurrying about and noise
as there was in the big square. Tents were
being put up like magic, camels were being
unloaded, and horses and donkeys and dromedaries
were stamping around, and little children
were tearing about everywhere and getting
in the way,&mdash;for many of the pilgrims
take their families with them.</p>

<p>"There are the tents of the Pacha, the chief
of the caravan," said Rashid, pointing to the
big green tents with gold crescents on their
tops. The Pacha's tents occupied the chief
place right in the middle of the square.</p>

<p>"The Pacha rides in a splendid litter swung
between two beautiful horses, and those must
be his dromedaries yonder with the rich trappings,"
said Rashid, who could explain all this
to his little companions, because each year he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had seen the caravan arrive and depart, always
with the same magnificence and splendour.</p>

<p>It is the religious duty of all good Mohammedans,
as the followers of the Great Prophet
are called, to make at least one pilgrimage to
Mecca, the capital city of Arabia, called the
"Holy City."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i101.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="camel and some people" />
<div class="caption">THE CARAVAN ON THE ROAD TO MECCA.</div>
</div>

<p>For this reason every year great caravans
from far and near journey across Arabia carrying
thousands of pilgrims to Mecca.</p>

<p>"See! see! I do believe there is Nawara,"
cried Fatimah, "there, just by the big tent."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is she," said Hamid, "and there is
the old merchant, too."</p>

<p>With one accord the three children ran
down into the square, dodging under camels
and around tents, until at last they got to
where Nawara was standing. The little girl
was so astonished to see her friends of the desert
that for a moment she could say nothing.
Then she threw her arms around Fatimah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
crying out how glad she was to see her
again.</p>

<p>"But, Nawara, what are you doing here?"
asked Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Grandfather is going to make the pilgrimage
to the Holy City, and we are going with
the caravan because it is safer," said Nawara,
in her little wise way. "Then, too, grandfather
will be able to sell his wares to the
pilgrims."</p>

<p>The old merchant now joined them and was
as pleased to see them again as was his little
granddaughter. He had already put on the
special dress that pilgrims wear, of white cloth
with red stripes, and carried a big rosary of
beads at his belt. When he told them that
the caravan would stay there until the next day
at evening, the children said that Nawara must
stay with them until all was ready for the departure.
So Nawara went to the great house
with Fatimah. Later the old merchant came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
too, and Rashid's mother gave them a nice
supper. They all sat around a big tray filled
with good things to eat, while Nawara told
the children of all that had happened to her
since they had parted in the desert.</p>

<p>All the next day the young folks waited for
the sound of the cannon, which was to be the
signal for the caravan to start. Every few
minutes one or the other of the boys would
rush into the house, saying that the gun had
gone off and the camels were going; but it
proved each time a false alarm, and Fatimah
had just told Nawara to make up her mind
to stay another night when the old merchant's
servant came rushing in to say that the head
of the caravan had already started and was
just then passing out the great gate. So once
more Nawara had to part from her kind little
friends.</p>

<p>The children ran up on top of the house,
and for a long time they could see the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
caravan winding over the hills and through
the plantations of palm-trees.</p>

<p>"Father, can't we go out to the palm groves
to-day to see the men gather the dates? Many
of the children of the city are going," begged
Rashid.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rashid's father. "I have no
doubt but that all you young folks will be
fighting together in no time, and there will be
more stones gathered than dates. Remember
what happened last week." So saying, the
Sharif sat back on the divan and took another
pull at his long pipe.</p>

<p>Rashid hung his head and tried to look
sorry; but his eye twinkled when he thought
of the wild scrimmage with sticks and stones
that had taken place between the boys of the
town and the boys outside the walls. He had
fought on the side of the city boys; and, of
course, Hamid, though he was of the desert
himself, sided with him. There was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
great jealousy between these two clans of boys,
and they were all the time carrying war into
each other's territory; but, after all, not much
damage was done on either side beyond some
bruised heads and a few broken sticks.</p>

<p>"Thou hast become quite a fighter since
thy life in the 'Black Tents,'" said his father;
"but if Ali will go along to keep thee from
getting into mischief, thou mayst go with thy
little friends." Ali said that he would go,
and they ran to saddle their ponies.</p>

<p>"How am I to go?" asked Fatimah.</p>

<p>"Oh, thou canst ride with me," said Hamid,
like the good brother that he was; and
Ali put her up on Zuleika behind Hamid.
Away they trotted out of the great gate
toward the large groves of palm-trees which
surround Medina.</p>

<p>The road was lively with parties of children
who, like themselves, were going to the palm
groves; for it was the season when the Bedouin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
farmers cut down the great bunches of
dates, and every one, especially the children,
made a regular picnic of it. All the children
of the city, apparently, were hurrying along,
some on horseback and many more on foot, all
bent on having a good time.</p>

<p>Just behind our young people came some
children riding on donkeys, trying their best
to make their little donkeys keep up with the
desert ponies of the boys.</p>

<p>Hamid looked back at them and sang out:</p>

<p>
"The riding of a horse is an honour to the rider<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And joyful is his face;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the mule is a dishonour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the donkey a disgrace."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then Rashid began to laugh. This made the
little donkey boys very angry. Off they jumped
from their donkeys, and were picking up stones
to throw at Rashid and his friends, while Ali
threatened them with his stick.</p>

<p>"No wonder father sent me with you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
look after you," said Ali, shaking his finger at
Hamid and Rashid as they rode on laughing,
"if you are bound to get into mischief as early
in the day as this."</p>

<p>"But all the same no Bedouin boy would
ride a donkey or a mule for anything," said
Hamid.</p>

<p>"That is quite true among you desert people,"
said Ali; "but these town and farmer
folk don't care on what they ride so long as
they do not have to walk."</p>

<p>Now they had come to a large grove of
palm-trees, and near one of the trees was a
man standing with a rope in his hand.</p>

<p>"Let us stop here," said Ali, calling out to
Rashid; "there is a man going to climb up
to the top of a tree now."</p>

<p>The children jumped quickly off their horses
and joined the group of people under the trees
watching the man.</p>

<p>He had tied one end of the rope around his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
waist and had passed it around the slim trunk
of the tree, attaching the other end also to his
waist. With this rope holding him well up
against the tree-trunk, he began to climb by
holding on to the rough bark wherever he
could get a hold for as much as one of his toes,
at the same time bracing himself against the
strong rope which held him.</p>

<p>"I should not like to do that," said Rashid.</p>

<p>"I wonder that he does not get giddy and
fall," said Fatimah.</p>

<p>But the man went up easily, though he had
a long way to climb. Like most date-palms,
the tree was very tall, and the leaves and fruit
all grew together on the very tip-top of the
great stem or trunk. It was, as Hamid said,
"just like the bunch of feathers on the end of
his spear."</p>

<p>When the man finally did reach the bunch
of dates, it was quite a job to cut through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
big stem, which was nearly as large around as
his arm.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a big bunch?" said Hamid, as
the man lowered the great golden-coloured
dates to the ground.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rashid, "but look, there must
be some larger bunches still, for some are tied
up to keep them from breaking off their
stems."</p>

<p>The women and children were collecting the
gathered dates and packing them in skins and
boxes and baskets to be sent away to the
markets; but the dried dates that we so often
eat are left much longer on the trees to ripen
and grow sugary.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hamid, thou and Fatimah must have
a 'necklace of <i>sham</i>' to wear! All the children
have them!" said Rashid, who had been
exploring the garden and had come running
quickly back. "There is a woman making
them now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman was threading dates on a string
and then dipping them into boiling water so
that they would keep their pretty golden colour.
Then she put them aside in the sun to
dry.</p>

<p>Rashid bargained with the woman for three
of the necklaces at once.</p>

<p>"It brings one good luck to wear a necklace
of the dates of Medina," said the woman as
she hung the strings of dates around the children's
necks; "and thou must not eat them
as this naughty one here has just done." She
frowned at her own little girl, who stood by
sobbing because her mother had just given her
a box on the ear for eating half of her new
necklace.</p>

<p>The children had a jolly time helping to
pick the dates and pack them, though likely
there was more play than work. And they
all ate so many dates it was a wonder that
they were not ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>At sundown they rode back to the town,
chaffing and laughing with everybody they met
along the road. When they got home, hot
and tired, Rashid's mother gave them a lovely
drink made of the juice of fresh pomegranates,
cooled in the snowy ice which was brought
down to the city each night from the neighbouring
mountains.</p>

<p>"Do you know why the letter 'O' is on
every date stone?" asked Rashid that evening
as he and Hamid were sitting in the courtyard
playing checkers with date stones, while Fatimah
sat watching the progress of the game.
They often occupied themselves thus in the
cool of the evening after supper.</p>

<p>"I have never seen the 'O;' where is it?"
asked Hamid, carefully looking at a date stone
as if he was only seeing one for the first time.</p>

<p>"There it is," said Rashid, who showed
him a tiny round ring on one side of the date
stone. "It is said that when our great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Prophet first ate of the fruit of the date-palm,
he exclaimed: 'Oh! what a fine fruit!' Ever
since the letter 'O' has been found on every
date stone."</p>

<p>Hamid and Fatimah began looking closely
at every date stone they could find; and, sure
enough, on every one of them there was a tiny
letter "O." You will always find it there, too,
if you look for it.</p>

<p>But the young people did not always play.
In the early mornings and cool evenings
Rashid and Hamid went to school in one corner
of the great Mosque. Here the pupils sat
in rows on mats, or lounged about on the floor.
Before each pupil was a little wooden stand,
on which lay a big book from which they
shouted out their lessons in a loud voice.
They made such a noise that one wonders how
they could learn anything at all.</p>

<p>The other children called Hamid the little
"Sheik" and often they would forget all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
about lessons while they listened to his stories
about the great desert. Meantime Fatimah
was learning how to make many nice new
dishes in the big kitchen at home, or she sat
with her mother in the women's part of the
house, learning how to sew like little city
girls.</p>

<p>But, in spite of these happy days spent by
the desert folk with the "People of the
Walls," the little Bedouins began to long for
the great wide desert and its life of freedom.
Soon the end of their visit came; one day the
little caravan could be seen making its way
homeward to their own country far beyond the
plain which came up to the city walls.</p>

<p>The first news that Hamid sent Rashid
after he got home to the "Black Tents" was
about the robber chief. His band had paid a
ransom for him and he had been given his
liberty, after he had promised solemnly not
to attempt to rob or kill again. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
know that a promise made in the "Black
Tents" is never broken.</p>

<p>The interchange of visits between Hamid
and Rashid occurred regularly each year.
Rashid learned of the ways of the dwellers
in the "Black Tents;" and gained in health
and strength until even Hamid was not his
superior in hunting or the rougher games of
the plains. Hamid, on the other hand, learned
of the life in the Great City, and profited
much from the loving companionship of his
little friend among the "People of the
Walls." Fatimah, too, shared in the happy
visits and grew to be called "the beautiful
daughter of the Sheik, wise with the wisdom
of both desert and city."</p>

<p class='adtitle3'>The Little Colonel. <small>(Trade Mark.)</small></p>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine

France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel, and

of the "House Party" and the "Holidays."</p>
